# C LIBRARY
>Re-coded set of the libc functions

The project consists of 2 parts:
1)  Re-coded set of the libc functions, as defined in their
man. Functions are presenting the same prototype and behaviors as the originals.
Functions’ names prefixed by “ft_”. For instance strlen becomes
ft_strlen.

2)  A set of functions that are either not included in the
libc, or included in a different form. Some of these functions was useful to write Part
1’s functions.

## Installation
